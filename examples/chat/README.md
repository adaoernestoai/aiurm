# Chat Examples

This folder contains general examples of using the **AIURM Protocol** in direct chat simulations.  
These examples demonstrate how to structure conversational interactions with AI using markers, logic blocks, and references, without relying on external orchestration frameworks.  

## Purpose
- Show how AIURM enables **structured, traceable, explainable, and reusable** interactions in a simple chat setting.  
- Provide **step-by-step scenarios** that can be directly tested in an AI chat environment.  
- Serve as a baseline for comparing integrations with APIs or orchestration tools (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen).  

## How to Use
1. First, activate the protocol by following the official instructions at [aiurm.org/activation](https://aiurm.org/activation/).  
2. Open an AI chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT).  
3. Copy and paste the example scripts into the conversation.  
4. Observe how markers are created and referenced as the session progresses.
