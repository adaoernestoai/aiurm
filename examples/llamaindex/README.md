# LlamaIndex Examples

This folder contains examples of using the **AIURM Protocol** with **LlamaIndex** (formerly GPT Index).  
These cases demonstrate how markers can support structured queries and results in data indexing workflows.  

## Purpose
- Show how AIURM markers enhance traceability in document/query pipelines.  
- Provide examples of applying structured markers to data ingestion and retrieval.  
- Enable explainable outputs when combining indexed data with reasoning steps.  

## How to Use
1. First, activate the protocol at [aiurm.org/activation](https://aiurm.org/activation/).  
2. Review the sample LlamaIndex workflows and scripts, using the definitions available at [aiurm.org](https://aiurm.org).
