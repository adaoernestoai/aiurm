# CrewAI Examples

This folder contains examples of using the **AIURM Protocol** with **CrewAI**.  
It demonstrates how markers can be used to maintain structure and traceability in collaborative agent workflows.  

## Purpose
- Show how AIURM markers provide consistent references across CrewAI agent tasks.  
- Provide scenarios where structured markers improve explainability in group decision-making.  
- Bridge conversational workflows with agent-based orchestration.  

## How to Use
1. First, activate the protocol at [aiurm.org/activation](https://aiurm.org/activation/).  
2. Review the sample CrewAI workflows and scripts, using the definitions available at [aiurm.org](https://aiurm.org).
