# API Examples

This folder contains examples of using the **AIURM Protocol** with APIs.  
These cases simulate how structured markers can be applied in programmatic workflows outside of direct chat.  

## Purpose
- Demonstrate AIURM integration in API-based pipelines.  
- Show how markers can be passed, stored, and reused between systems.  
- Provide building blocks for automated workflows and backend services.  

## How to Use
1. First, activate the protocol at [aiurm.org/activation](https://aiurm.org/activation/).  
2. Review the sample API calls and scripts provided, using the definitions available at [aiurm.org](https://aiurm.org).
