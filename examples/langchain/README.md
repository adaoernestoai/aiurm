# LangChain Examples

This folder contains examples of using the **AIURM Protocol** inside **LangChain** workflows.  
It demonstrates how AIURM markers can coexist with LangChainâ€™s orchestration features.  

## Purpose
- Show how AIURM can add **structured interaction and traceability** inside LangChain chains.  
- Provide simple pipelines combining LangChain tools with AIURM markers.  
- Bridge conversational markers with orchestration logic.  

## How to Use
1. First, activate the protocol at [aiurm.org/activation](https://aiurm.org/activation/).  
2. Review the sample LangChain workflows and scripts provided, using the definitions available at [aiurm.org](https://aiurm.org).
