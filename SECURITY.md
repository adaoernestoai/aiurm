# Security Reporting – AIURM Examples Repository

This repository contains experimental examples, flows, and integrations created to demonstrate the use of the AIURM protocol (Artificial Intelligence User Reference Markers).  

AIURM is a conceptual protocol provided as an open draft under the public domain (CC0). The purpose of this repository is to support the community with practical resources for testing, learning, and collaborative development.

> **This repository does not contain production-critical code.**  
> All integrations and examples are exploratory and should be adapted with care before being used in sensitive environments.
